  [[https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-request-body.html#request-body-search-from-size][search_request_body from_size]]
  Inside the body of the request you can add
  #+BEGIN_SRC python
  "from" : 0, "size" : 10,
  #+END_SRC

  like
  #+BEGIN_SRC python
  {
      "from" : 0, "size" : 10,
      "query": {
          "bool": {
              "minimum_should_match": "1",
              "should": [
                  {
                      "multi_match": {
                          "query": "banane",
                          "fuzziness": "AUTO",
                          "type": "most_fields",
                          "fields": [
                              "title^5",
                              "title.stemmed^5",
                              "titleReword^3",
                              "titleReword.stemmed^3"
                          ]
                      }
                  }
              ]
          }
      }
  }
  #+END_SRC

  Remark
  The number of hits stays the same, so be aware if you use this field i.e. in 
  "Search results: 47"

  Inside the search request body we use a suggester
  [[https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-suggesters.html][Suggesters]]
  #+BEGIN_SRC python
    "suggest": {
        "text": "banane",
        "suggest-title": {
            "term": {
                "field": "title"
            }
        },
        "suggest-responses": {
            "term": {
                "field": "responses.body"
            }
        }
  #+END_SRC

  With that we get this inside the response body

  #+BEGIN_SRC python
      "suggest": {
        "suggest-responses": [
            {
                "text": "banane",
                "offset": 0,
                "length": 6,
                "options": [
                    {
                        "text": "banque",
                        "score": 0.6666666,
                        "freq": 26
                    },
                    {
                        "text": "bagage",
                        "score": 0.6666666,
                        "freq": 1
                    },
                    {
                        "text": "bonne",
                        "score": 0.6,
                        "freq": 1
                    }
                ]
            }
        ],
        "suggest-title": [
            {
                "text": "banane",
                "offset": 0,
                "length": 6,
                "options": [
                    {
                        "text": "banque",
                        "score": 0.6666666,
                        "freq": 7
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
  #+END_SRC

  Each options array contains an option object that includes the:
  - suggested text, 
  - its document frequency and
  - score compared to the suggest entry text. 

  The meaning of the score depends on the used suggester. The term suggester’s score is based on the edit distance.

  So you can retrieve the words, by inspecting the suggester. You might filter them by the frequency.


  
   
  

* Réglages suggester
  
  [[https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.8/search-suggesters-term.html][Suggester parameters]]

** General
   
   - analyzer (the same analyzer that is used for the fields - don't change)

   - size 
     The maximum corrections to be returned per suggest text token
     default: no restriction

   - sort
     score and frequency - lexical order, but can change priority on score or frequency
     default: first score then frequency

   - suggest-mode
     controls what suggestions are included
     controls for what suggest text terms, suggestions should be suggested

     - missing (default)
       Only provide suggestions for suggest text terms that are not in the index.

     - popular (interesting)
       Only suggest suggestions that occur in more docs than the original suggest text term

     - always (not so good)
       Suggest any matching suggestions based on terms in the suggest text.

** Distance
   
   - max_edits (defaults = 2)
     probably easiest way to limit that

     - banane - banque (q to a, n to u)
     - banane - bonne (a to o, delete a)
     - banane - bagage (g to n, g to n)

   - prefix_length (defaults = 1)
     
     number of minimal prefix characters that must match in order be a candidate for suggestions
     Increasing this number improves spellcheck performance. 
     Usually misspellings don’t occur in the beginning of terms.

   - min_word_length (default = 4)
     The minimum length a suggest text term must have in order to be included.

   - string_distance - algorithm to use (default = internal, optimized for performance)
     - other damerau_levenshtein, levenshtein, jaro_winkler, ngram

   - min_doc_freq, max_term_freq ()
     complicated to set that in a global manner

   - others

     - shard_size, max_inspections
